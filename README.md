# Vartalap - A Chat List.

The idea of this project is based on the implementation of LRU cache.
LRU cache can be implemented by the combination of two data structures, HashMap and Linked-List.
The difference between this chatlist and LRU cache is that there is no size limit constraint to the cache in this project. Here chat list is being referred to as cache.
